Hey guys so welcome to my channel or welcome back if you've been following me for a while. Either way I hope that you're all in my Facebook group which is called Recruiter Empire. In description there's 10,000 recruiters in the group sharing tons of content and material that is definitely going to be valuable for you. Anyways click that link and make sure you're in the group. All right so I'm pretty sure that everyone knows about automation. We've been talking about artificial intelligence, AI for years now and robots and how they're going to do various things and replace all of us and all this kind of jazz but it's actually here now and we're actually using it. So far it's proven to be actually really beneficial for us and so I want to hop into my computer and screen share to show you exactly how you can automate pretty much everything in your recruiting business. Let's go. So right off the top we're going to go into client acquisition right so this is how you would automate client acquisition and I'm going to be using a tool called the data scraper. There's a lot of tools but this is the tool that I use and it's super effective. So basically you create a list and I'm going to do construction managers and what I'm going to do is I'm going to be scraping for these construction managers so I'm just going to refresh that real quick just make sure that the list is in there. Okay cool.\\n\\nSo then I pop over to sales navigator right super easy everybody knows sales navigator if you don't have it definitely get it. So sales navigator I already did a little bit of the legwork here so I already applied all the filters. I want construction managers that are in Houston, their manager level and they're in the construction industry and I actually got my list to about 2,500. Now this is actually paramount because when you're using the data scraper you do need to make sure that your list is searching for around 2,500 otherwise it's not going to pull more emails than that. That's just simply how LinkedIn works. I get this question from my mentorship program all the time. Why doesn't LinkedIn show me the next person after 2,500 or the next 2,500 after that? It doesn't work like that so just keep that in mind. So as I have this search right here right so I've got that search I'm going to refresh it real quick always good idea to do.\\n\\nAll I have to do is basically save this search and just name it construction manager Houston save search go to my actual save searches right and let's find it where are we at here construction manager Houston got it so now that I've brought it back up we're perfectly ready to actually scrape the list so as you can see these purple bars down here these are data scraper so the bottom one is actually what I'm going to hit and it's going to bring up this little box just to make sure that I'm on the right list I want to scrape to and I'm literally going to click one button and this thing is going to immediately start scraping so as you can see it's doing it right now counting down two seconds one second it's going through page one page two this will probably take less than 40 minutes so for me to get 2500 potential prospect emails it's about 40 minutes or so and you can scrape unlimited emails with the data scraper with that being said that is how I grab tons and tons of emails and as you can see if we refresh this you're going to see this blowing up right here so right away we've already gathered 50 emails right so out of I'm sorry 46 emails out of 50 contacts so if I just keep refreshing I can see that list going up and up and up so there we go almost 80 emails out of 75 contacts so that's going to go through the entire list this 2500 person list and I can run another list and another list another list and I could do 10,000 emails in one particular day all right so clearly the\\n\\nquestion is what do I do with all the emails after I get them right so automating the rest of your process once you do get these emails let's just say we stop this list right now in its tracks and paused it right away so that it's done so okay I'm I know I have you know a smaller amount of emails than 2500 but still I'm going to have a good amount so let's say there we go 187 emails I can click this download button and I can immediately download a CSV file or an Excel file depends on what device you're on but I can open it up it's going to show me all the emails right away and their contact information and their LinkedIn URL and a bunch of other stuff by their company and all that so here's the emails though right this is the most important part we want the emails so basically all I have to do is go ahead and clean up this list using you know the organize and sort options to actually make sure that I remove all the spacing and get rid of a few things and once this list is cleaned up I would take this and save it I would go into my CRM personally for me I'm used on Traport and with my CRM I would just go to my contacts settings boom import contacts and just drag and drop that file straight in there so that's exactly how I would do it so once I get all my emails in here they are clearly ready to be sent out on email campaigns which is something that I'll talk about next in the video so while we're on LinkedIn let's talk about automating your LinkedIn workflow so I personally\\n\\nknow people that spend all day on LinkedIn and that's incredibly useless when you're just hunting and pecking and searching and connecting messaging following up it's super useless when you can utilize a tool that will automate the entire workflow for you so with that being said myself and a partner have actually created a tool called Aspharis which basically does everything I mentioned above visits profiles connects with profiles messages people for you follows up with people for you all that stuff and I'll show you briefly exactly how it works so in your Chrome browser if you simply go to app.aspharis.io right it's going to take you to a simple screen that's going to actually have you log in with your LinkedIn account because those two need to talk to each other to be able to actually run all the automation so my screen is going to look different right now than it will for you but with that being said if you head here what you're going to see is basically all the capabilities that we were talking about previously so you create message templates right so a connection request template hi I see that you're a CEO wanting to connect to you because I have an awesome opportunity for someone blah blah blah by the way this can work for candidates as well so this this message template sequence is actually set up to follow up with candidates so not only client acquisition but also candidates right so message templates aside let's talk about action sequences so action sequences are\\n\\nbasically where we put all of the templates together so I would name this candidates for construction or something like that right priority don't worry about that right now first thing I'm going to do is I want to visit that person's profile so when I import somebody I want to visit their profile just so they I saw that I visited them maybe they want to connect instantly maybe they're like oh that's interesting Ben took a look at my profile maybe I'll connect with him whatever but I want to do that no delay so delay none right step two is my connection so I'm going to put that message template connection request template I'm going to do that actually one day after I visit them so you can set the cadence right the third step that I'm going to do is I'm going to send them a message and this is a follow-up message after they've connected with me if they haven't responded to me already right I'm not going to go too into in-depth on this because we're going to do plenty of other videos and I'm also going to do a full live event here probably by the end of the month with my partner about as far as and how it works but I'm going to do follow-up message number one and I'm going to wait another day maybe two days actually to do that and then I'll do step number four which will also be another message if they if they haven't said anything yet and that'll be follow-up number two and I will wait how about one day for that so first day I'm visiting their profile doing nothing but just\\n\\nchecking it out second day I'm sending them a connection request with a connection note that I've customized under my message templates the third day I'm following up if they've connected with me saying hey thanks so much for your connection you know I'd love to talk to you blah blah blah whatever if they don't say anything after that I send them a second follow-up and then we go from there if at any point during the action sequence right somebody actually does engage with me like they connect and they say hey Ben thanks for connecting right all the automation turns off so all you have to do is set up an action sequence right go back into sales nav just like we did for data scraper to find emails I'll use the same exact list construction managers right and say I was poaching say I'm trying to find candidates that are in this niche and I have the same exact list all I have to do is go to my safe searches just same way we did before and go to grab my construction managers there they are top of list so grab them once again open it up make sure it's all refreshed cool got the same list again as far as imports 2500 profiles at a time however you can also do as many 2500 lists as you want per day so you could upload 10 20 000 profiles to as far as every single day just like you can pull 10 20 000 emails using data scraper every single day so on as far as here's how it works if I have the list opened up right I click on my as far as icon really really simple it's going to ask me how\\n\\nmany profiles do I want to import the maximum is 2500 so that's what I want to do and which sequence do I want to add them to now we just created that construction candidates for construction sequence that's what I want to do and I would just simply click import prospects right so with that being said let's pretend I did that actually go to as far as and if I go in I'm going to see all of my prospects that I've imported so let's just say these are all the people I've imported it's going to tell me what happened did they connect with me did they view it and not do anything and it'll have all the timestamps on here and tell you everything that's going on tell you how many prospects are in your queue pending connections that you have right now I have 111 you can actually bulk withdraw those there's all kinds of things you can do and basically we found that overall using as far as to automate your LinkedIn workflow is probably going to save you around 15 to 20 hours a week on LinkedIn think about that time also data scraper finding emails probably saving you another 10 hours at least per week on finding data so about 90% of all of your leads that turn into actual recruiting clients come from two sources that would be LinkedIn interactions and cold email outreach so when we automate both of those tools in a way that saves you like 40 hours a week in actual manual work you've created an actual lead generation machine on acid times 10 so with that being said you've got to understand\\n\\nthe power of what this automation is actually doing for you another problem is people sending out email in small batches I'm talking about people sending out like 100 emails or just 150 emails a day that's not going to get you anywhere right after working with thousands of students I can tell you you have to be sending out multiple thousands of emails per day like 1500 to 2000 emails a day in order to get some actual responses conversations and eventually contracts right so that's what we want to do we want to pull a list of 2500 emails clean the data make sure it's good and then upload it in here into your CRM so let's just say for demonstration purposes that I go to my import contacts right I get those people imported into my CRM the emails are there and then I want to run an automation I want to run a sequence so quick short example right I'm going to go into here this is basically email automation at its finest right so this tree might be really really complicated to look at but once I run through this and customize it just once one time I am ready to go forever so basically I have my email files added to campaigns right which is what I want eventually because what we need to do is be sending out email sequences okay so I'm talking six to eight emails right between anywhere from four days five days six days apart really depends on personal preference and what you like but I like to do anywhere from seven emails about four to five days apart that gets people's attention so\\n\\nthis tree right here is going to automate that whole thing for me and there's so many different aspects personally on this this tool which is Entroport but many other people use different CRMs that's fine but I can send people an email I can send it here down the tree and then have them go to a certain other email if they respond I can if they don't respond I can have them go and just sit on a wait period and then send them another email and then I can have them wait however long I want two days one day whatever it needs to be send them another email after that send them another wait period I can set that to one day or four days whatever I want and then eventually wait wait update the contact if I need to and end the sequence so bottom line don't really pay attention to the actual tree here it doesn't really matter all that matters is the fact that we are automating our outreach to an insane degree to the point where you literally set it and forget it so we're talking about scraping emails like crazy grabbing tons of email like let's say we do 5000 emails per day then we go clean that data using a tool like Neverbounce right Neverbounce is a great tool to actually clean data so you would sign in and clean up a list right so we say we pop in and you're cleaning up a list of emails you want to make sure just add a list right and make sure that all those emails are valid once they're valid you can then put them into your CRM and let them run on a sequence of course six to eight\\n\\nemails four to five days apart so not only are we getting all of our emails on data scraper we're cleaning them on Neverbounce or another cleaning tool whatever you want to use it doesn't matter they're all automation once we do that we're setting them up into our CRM setting them up on a sequence like something like this which is a little bit intense some of you guys are using some different things that are simpler but with that being said that's email flow that's cold email outreach sequence automation also on top of that while you're doing all that you're running aspharis on LinkedIn in the background so you're sitting there and all of these prospects are being hit with connections visits messages follow-ups all that stuff so all I have to do is basically open up my LinkedIn and just sit there and literally stare at my inbox and just wait right so all I have to do is wait for who responded to what who you know who responded to my message outbounds all that kind of stuff so automating this stuff is really really insane it's going to save you 40 hours out of your week if you're using all of it to automate everything and it's also going to get you so many more deals so automate everything always always remember that you want to be working on the business and not in the business so automation is one way that you can absolutely do that by delegating these things to robots so with that being said do yourself a favor grab automation tools set them all up let them run for you and\\n\\nbasically get more time freed up so that you can work on things that are more important within the business hey so again join our Facebook group recruiter empire there is a link in the description click that link and
